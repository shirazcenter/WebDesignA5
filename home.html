<h2> Ending Deforestation </h2>
  <p>Today, empty land holds a greater worth than functional ecosystems needed to sustain our lives. 

The 500,000 hectares of forest and bush destroyed each year leaves our towns and cities hotter and less liveable, killing wildlife and smothering the reef in the process.

<h2> Protecting the Pilliga Forest </h2>
  <p>Santos, a coal seam gas company plans on building its 95,000 hectare Narrabri Gas Project, within the Pilliga Forest. The Forest feeds clean water into the Artesian Basin and is a refuge for our native wildlife. 

We want to see this project eliminated, allowing for the future the Australian landscape deserves.
